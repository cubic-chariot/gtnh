Getting Started
===============

The first thing that happens when you join the world described above is:
you fall in the void and die.
This creates an OpenBlocks grave with a block of dirt underneath.
Due to spawn randomization,
when you respawn,
you will likely fall to the void and die again.
And again, and again, and again.
Once you respawn on top of a grave,
throw yourself in the void a few hundred times more to gather building blocks.
Then we progress as follows:

- Build a rudimentary mobfarm.
    Kill enough infernal mobs until one of them drops a golden apple,
    and open enough treasure bags from Thaumcraft until you get a splash potion of weakness.

- Find a zombie villager in your mob farm and cure it in vanilla way
    (throw a splash potion of weakness and feed it a golden apple).
    - Alternatively, you can skip the splash potion of weakness
        by using a witch, or an infernal mob with the attribute "alchemist".
        These mobs throw weakness potions at you,
        and these may also hit mobs behind you.

- Convert a few more villagers.
    Botania makes them shed emeralds,
    so you can purchase a Pam's sapling from a farmer.
    (Even without shedding,
    Cleric villagers trade rotten flesh for emeralds,
    and you just need one emerald to get a sapling.)
    This gives access to wood.

- The crafting table recipe was unfortunately Gregified.
    Brutish skeletons and zombies drop flint when killed,
    giving access to crafting tables and chests.
    Ninja skeletons drop paper,
    so we can craft Tinker's Construct's Blank Patterns,
    thus giving access to the part builder, stencil table, and tool station.
    The part builder can be used to make tool parts out of bone,
    which also generates bone meal as a byproduct,
    without needing a macerator.

- Go back to your mob farm and wait till a drowning creeper appears.
    Let it explode.
    This generates water and some cobblestone.
    Your TiCon pickaxe can mine those,
    or you can use a GT flint pickaxe.
    Craft a furnace.
    This gives us stone and thus mortars.

- Zombies drop iron ingots, which can be used to make buckets and a full set of Gregtech tools.
    They also drop potatoes and carrots,
    which allows us to get started with crops!
    (Infernal mobs sometimes drop hoes.)
    Aim for the oreberries.
    Infernal mobs also rarely drop diamonds,
    so you can make a plant lens (buy glass from a librarian villager).

- Oreberries don't need the corresponding block underneath to drop their resource.
    Use the mortar to get tiny dusts
    and smelt them in furnace to get ingots.
    Mixing tin and copper in a crafting table gives us access to bronze.

- Build a Railcraft Iron Tank.
    The walls only need iron,
    and the valve needs bronze.
    Place a valve on top of the tank,
    craft an XP drain,
    and place it over the valve.
    Congratulations, now you have access to XP buckets!

- Get clay dust from XP buckets,
    transform it into clay balls and then to unfired clay bricks,
    and smelt and assemble them into brick blocks.
    Together with the bronze,
    this gives us much of steam age:
    small coal boiler,
    steam alloy smelter,
    steam compressor (infernal mobs drop pistons),
    steam extractor,
    steam macerator,
    steam forge hammers (as the compressor gives us iron blocks).
    The Railcraft Water Tank is doable here as well.

- Forge hammers can hammer the drowning creeper's cobblestone down to gravel and sand.
    So we can make unfired coke oven bricks
    and assemble coke ovens;
    this gives us access to charcoal and thus torches!
    With XP buckets this allows us to make and use a Bricked Blast Furnace.

- Crop breeding gives stickreed which gives raw rubber dust.
    XP buckets gives sulfur.
    Since we have a steam alloy smelter,
    we get access to rubber.
    So we can now craft LV motors.

- You probably got some weeds during crop breeding.
    If they are left to mature,
    they will transform nearby farmland into grass blocks.
    Let the grass spread;
    this allows passive mobs to spawn.

- Librarian villagers sell bookshelves,
    Heretic villagers sell profane wands,
    and a Thaumcraft table can be made using only iron and wood.
    Witches drop glass bottles,
    you got rubber a few steps above,
    chickens gives feathers,
    and crops gives us ink sacs;
    thus we can craft scribing tools.
    This allows us to get started with Thaumcraft.

- Make a Lazullia, from Thaumic Bases.
    This gives us lapis lazuli,
    which can be used to make the clockwork engine from Forestry.
    We can now power Forestry machines.

- Craft obsidian dust with XP buckets.
    Make obsidian glass with it in an alloy smelter,
    which can be used to craft Buildcraft Tanks.

- Copper from oreberries and nickel from XP buckets
    can be alloyed into cupronickel in an alloy smelter.
    Many machines from Forestry can be made without circuits,
    needing only cupronickel and lapis lazuli plates,
    BC tanks, electric motors and pistons, and small steel gears.
    We can make bottlers, centrifuges, fermenters, moisteners, and squeezers.
    (The carpenter needs robot arms, which needs circuits.)

- Apiarist villagers sell random combs for two wheat.
    Get one that sells simmering combs,
    centrifuge it to get phosphor,
    which can be squeezed (together with dirt) into lava.
    (Thanks `Bigfluf#3586` for pointing this out!)

- Make a vanilla cobble generator.
    Forge hammer the cobble to get gravel and sand.
    Sand and rotten flesh from your mob farm gives plenty of dirt,
    which can be made into plenty of mud and extracted to clay.
    Make a Tinker's Construct Smeltery and power it with the lava you got in the last step.

- Now make a ball mold, glass tubes, vacuum tubes, and LV circuits.
    (Red alloy cables can be made in an alloy smelter with rubber and red alloy wires.)
    Congratulations, you've reached the LV age!


Additional and Alternative Strategies
-------------------------------------

- Draconic Evolution's "Place Item in world" feature
    (default keybind: P)
    creates tile entities with a collision box of 0.5x0.1x0.5
    and the same blast resistance as obsidian.
    Those are useful to protect against creeper explosions
    and also as makeshift slabs,
    to prevent mob spawning in the absence of torches.

- Infernal mobs rarely drop gold blocks,
    which can be used to craft Extra Utilities' golden spikes.
    This make it possible to farm mobs somewhat automatically,
    which is an easier way of getting the 222 iron ingots required for the Railcraft tank
    than oreberries.
    Only player kills (and things that simulate player kills)
    can drop iron ingots,
    so you need something like this in order to get the ingots.

- Golden spikes also give XP,
    which speeds up XP bucket crafting before obtaining a large field of essence berries.

- Hoeing grass gives cotton seeds,
    which gives access to the Extra Utilities' paintbrush,
    which can be used
    (together with the bone meal from the part builder)
    to craft white colored oak wood planks.
    These planks are fire-proof and have higher blast resistance than cobblestone,
    making it a good building material.

- Bookshelves gives access to Forestry Worktables,
    which significantly speed up the microcrafting needed for LV components.

- After unlocking steel,
    GT++'s Steam Grinder becomes craftable,
    and very useful to macerate all the oreberries.
