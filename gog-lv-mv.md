LV and MV
=========

At this point,
you should have a BBF or two,
a steady source of steam,
a TiCon smeltery with lava,
and LV circuits.

- Aluminum brass and lava gives access to all molds and extruder shapes.
    The plate mold can be used to make rubber sheets in the steam alloy smelter.
    With a knife we can craft rubber rings.
    This gives us access to most LV machine parts:
    casings,
    hulls,
    electric motors,
    electric pumps,
    conveyor modules,
    electric pistons,
    and robot arms.
    (The only missing ones are field generators, sensors and emitters.
    The last two will be obtainable shortly,
    but the first one will take a while.)

- We can now craft the majority of LV machines:
    assemblers,
    benders,
    canning machines,
    cutting machines (use XP buckets to get cobalt brass),
    extruders,
    lathes,
    recyclers (get glowstone from wiches or crops),
    wiremills, 
    centrifuges,
    electrolyzers,
    thermal centrifuges,
    ore washing plants,
    packagers,
    unpackagers,
    chemical reactors,
    rock breakers,
    disassemblers,
    fermenters,
    fluid extractors,
    fluid solidifiers,
    distilleries,
    chemical baths,
    polarizers,
    electromagnetic separators,
    autoclaves,
    mixers,
    forming presses,
    forge hammers,
    fluid heaters,
    combustion generators,
    gas turbines,
    steam turbines,
    and world accelerators.

    The exceptions are
    scanners,
    mass fabricators,
    replicators,
    breweries, 
    precision laser engravers,
    sifting machines,
    arc and plasma furnaces,
    circuit assemblers,
    monster repellators,
    and crop managers.

    - You can also make electric versions of the
        alloy smelter,
        compressor,
        extractors,
        furnace,
        and macerator, 
        but you should probably still use the steam versions in the beginning.

    - You can also make printers, disassemblers, pumps, seis
        and later on microwaves and pollution scrubbers,
        but these are not useful in Skyblock.

    - You _can_ make battery buffers and slicing machines,
        but without being able to make batteries or slicer blades
        (respectively)
        they are not very useful.

    - You can make amplifabricators but these are not useful without mass fabricators.

- The crops Salty Root and Evil Ore drops certus quartz dust,
    which can be processed (together with sodium from Salty Roots) into certus quartz (the gem).
    Cobalt brass can be crafted from XP buckets and centrifuged to get brass dust.
    Smelting and lathing it gives brass roods,
    and thus LV sensors and emitters.
    Thus we can now craft scanners,
    precision laser engravers, monster repellators, and crop managers.
    - Alternatively, villagers sell certus quartz dust directly.

- With the assembler we can craft the 3x3 schematics.
    Together with recyclers,
    packages,
    and unpackagers,
    this enables the automation of creation and opening of scrap boxes.

- The next step is crafting and powering an EBF.
    Cupronickel coils can be made with alumino silicate wool,
    which is made from either blue/green sapphire dust or ruby dust, and quartz or silicon dioxide.
    The silicon dioxide is easy to get by centrifuging flint dust or glass dust,
    or you may go for quartz dust from Evil Ores.
    The blue/green sapphire or ruby is harder.
    The IC2 crop Sapphirum gives sapphire and it is quite fast in this task;
    however, it requires a full block of sapphire underneath it to mature,
    and the only initial source of blue sapphires is scrapboxes.
    So your best bet is probably getting ruby dust by centrifuging large quantities of redstone.
    Its best source is Thaumic Bases' Redlons.
    OpenBlocks' Block Breaker can automatically harvest the redstone blocks
    (Project Red's block breaker gets stuck, due to the redstone power).

- Aluminium oreberries will provide aluminium dust,
    which can be compressed into Tinker's Construct's Raw Aluminium,
    which can be smelted into GT aluminium ingots.
    Redstone alloy needs coal dust;
    you can get some from scrapboxes and by centrifuging fire charges,
    but the best renewable source is probably withereeds.
    - Withereeds needs coal blocks underneath them to mature.
        Fire Creepers, Skeletons, and Zombies drop coal,
        so mob farming is a slow way of getting some coal to kickstart a withereed field.
        Unfortunately coal dust cannot be transformed into coal.

- Gallium and arsenide can be obtained from XP buckets.
    Sodium and chlorine (for the phenolic circuit board)
    can come from either tearstalks or salty roots.
    Melting glass in a smeltery, or fluid-extracting quartzite,
    gives us diodes and thus MV circuits.

- At this point,
    most basic MV machine components
    (motors, pumps, conveyors, pistons, robot arms, and emitters)
    are available.
    The only exception is the MV sensor,
    which needs flawless emeralds.

- Most MV machines are available now,
    including MV generators and precision laser engravers.
    The most notable exception are MV lathes,
    which needs flawless diamonds,
    and MV crop managers,
    which needs flawless emeralds.

- Kanthal coil blocks won't be craftable for a while,
    so several materials will not be accessible until then
    (titanium, tantalum, energetic alloy, vibrant alloy,
    nichrome, solar grade silicon, galgadorian, energetic silver, vivid alloy).

- Stainless steel dust is technically achievable.
    Chrome can be mass produced from ruby from redstone,
    but the only source of manganese at this point is
    scrap -> red garnet dust -> spessartine dust -> manganese dust.
    But actually smelting stainless steel is not.

Additional and Alternative Strategies
-------------------------------------

- If you are using the questbook,
    purchasing and processing diamond ores gives access to graphite,
    which unlocks arc furnaces.
    Arc furnaces are not required,
    but very useful for making glass and annealed copper more cheaply.

- Cobalt brass from XP buckets can be used to get zinc,
    which gives item filters and item filter covers.
    These move one stack per tick,
    so with an empty blacklist these function as an IV conveyor.

- [Project Red: Transportation](https://gtnh.miraheze.org/wiki/Project_Red_Transportation_-_MV_Storage_and_Autocrafting)
    is unlocked as soon as you have aluminium ingots,
    which helps immensely when fighting microcrafting.
    - XP bucket autocrafting is a must.
        If the crafting is performed on demand,
        consider powering the auto crafting benches
        (with e.g. Project Red: Expansion's solar panels)
        to outpace PRT.

- With aluminium from the EBF and blaze rods from blazereed,
    you can craft breweries,
    which give access to brewing machines and weed-ex.

- Piston boots, copterpacks, and GT concrete can be crafted for faster movement.

The Lens Obstacle
=================

This is the first and most important roadblock of the Skyblock journey:
crafting the lenses necessary for progression.
- Either terra or emerald lenses
    are needed to make Ultra Low Power IC, which is needed for MV energy hatches.
- Either ruby, ignis, or red garnet lenses
    are needed for Integrated Logic Circuits, which is a component of HV circuits.
- Green sapphire lenses are needed for Random Access Memory Chips,
    which is a component of HV circuits.

The inability of getting lenses
is directly tied with the inability to get flawless and exquisite gems.

- Plates can be lathed into lenses by an MV lathe.
    However,
    crafting the MV lathe itself needs a flawless diamond.
- Exquisite gems can be lathed into lenses by an LV lathe.
    However,
    due to the absence of ores this option is not available for us.
- Both the LV and HV lathes can be crafted using industrial diamonds,
    which can be crafted at this stage.
    However,
    the HV lathe needs HV circuits to begin with.
- Implosion compressors can upgrade gems to flawless and exquisite variants.
    However, the implosion compressor also needs HV circuits.
- An HV precision laser engraver can upgrade regular diamonds to flawless diamonds,
    but again it requires HV circuits.
- Other HV-tier circuits either needs cleanrooms (which needs HV circuits to begin with).

Magic is probably useless here;
not only we are severely limited by the lack of Thaumcraft infusion
(which needs a ruby/ignis/red garnet lens),
flawless and exquisite gems are a GT concept,
so the only way a magic mod could help is by giving the ores directly.
- Botania's orechid would be up to the task,
    but it needs sunnarium

The only crop which produces ores is the garnydinia,
which rarely drops purified red/yellow garnet ore and purified garnet sand.
It is also the only crop which produces exquisite gems
(it drops exquisite red and yellow garnets).
This would give access to Thaumcraft infusion, at least.
However,
garnydinias need either a red or a yellow garnet block to fully mature.
Since scrapboxes only drop red/yellow garnet dust,
we need an implosion compressor first.

Diamond combs can be reacted with HCl to produce purified diamond ores.
However villagers don't sell those,
breeding diamond bees requires biome-changing technology,
and even getting bees in the first place requires the questbook.
The diamond bee also gates red garnet and ruby bees.
