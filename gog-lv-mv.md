LV and MV
=========

At this point,
you should have a BBF or two,
a steady source of steam,
a TiCon smeltery with lava,
and LV circuits.

- Aluminum brass and lava gives access to all molds and extruder shapes.
    The plate mold can be used to make rubber sheets in the steam alloy smelter.
    With a knife we can craft rubber rings.
    This gives us access to most LV machine parts:
    casings,
    hulls,
    electric motors,
    electric pumps,
    conveyor modules,
    electric pistons,
    and robot arms.
    (The only missing ones are field generators, sensors and emitters.
    The last two will be obtainable shortly,
    but the first one will take a while.)

- We can now craft the majority of LV machines:
    assemblers,
    benders,
    canning machines,
    cutting machines (use XP buckets to get cobalt brass),
    extruders,
    lathes,
    recyclers (get glowstone from wiches or crops),
    wiremills, 
    centrifuges,
    electrolyzers,
    thermal centrifuges,
    ore washing plants,
    packagers,
    unpackagers,
    chemical reactors,
    rock breakers,
    disassemblers,
    fermenters,
    fluid extractors,
    fluid solidifiers,
    distilleries,
    chemical baths,
    polarizers,
    electromagnetic separators,
    autoclaves,
    mixers,
    forming presses,
    forge hammers,
    fluid heaters,
    combustion generators,
    gas turbines,
    steam turbines,
    and world accelerators.

    The exceptions are
    scanners,
    mass fabricators,
    replicators,
    breweries, 
    precision laser engravers,
    sifting machines,
    arc and plasma furnaces,
    circuit assemblers,
    monster repellators,
    and crop managers.

    - You can also make electric versions of the
        alloy smelter,
        compressor,
        extractors,
        furnace,
        and macerator, 
        but you should probably still use the steam versions in the beginning.

    - You can also make printers, disassemblers, pumps, seis
        and later on microwaves and pollution scrubbers,
        but these are not useful in Skyblock.

    - You _can_ make battery buffers and slicing machines,
        but without being able to make batteries or slicer blades
        (respectively)
        they are not very useful.

    - You can make amplifabricators but these are not useful without mass fabricators.

- The crops Salty Root and Evil Ore drops certus quartz dust,
    which can be processed (together with sodium from Salty Roots) into certus quartz (the gem).
    Cobalt brass can be crafted from XP buckets and centrifuged to get brass dust.
    Smelting and lathing it gives brass roods,
    and thus LV sensors and emitters.
    Thus we can now craft scanners,
    precision laser engravers, monster repellators, and crop managers.
    - Alternatively, villagers sell certus quartz dust directly.

- With the assembler we can craft the 3x3 schematics.
    Together with recyclers,
    packages,
    and unpackagers,
    this enables the automation of creation and opening of scrap boxes.

Additional and Alternative Strategies
-------------------------------------

- If you are using the questbook,
    purchasing and processing diamond ores gives access to graphite,
    which unlocks arc furnaces.
    Arc furnaces are not required,
    but very useful for making glass and annealed copper more cheaply.

- Cobalt brass from XP buckets can be used to get zinc,
    which gives item filters and item filter covers.
    These move one stack per tick,
    so with an empty blacklist these function as an IV conveyor.
