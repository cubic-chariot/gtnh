Efficient Manual Oreberry Farming
=================================

This article describes an efficient way of manually farming oreberries planted on IC2 cropsticks.
The method described here is by no means competitive with automatic farming
and should only be used if Gregtech's Crop Manager is inaccessible
(e.g. in [skyblock](./garden-of-grind.md)).


Problem Statement
-----------------

The goal is to make the process of manually farming oreberries as efficient as possible.
"Efficient" means the player should spend as little as possible walking in the farm.

The main obstacle is that,
when the oreberry is harvested (right-clicked),
the oreberry item flies to a random direction.
The design below minimizes backtracking to grab the items that fly away from the player.
