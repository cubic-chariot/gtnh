Late MV to EV
=============

Right now we progressed through most of MV,
and cheated in a flawless diamond to make an MV lathe
(or processed diamond ore from the questbook).

- Make a pyrolyze oven;
    this is an easy source of toluene (from wood tar)
    and ethylene (from wood gas).
    Polyethylene will be needed for circuit components.

- The only source of green sapphire is scrap.
    Scrap also gives rubies,
    but the red lens can also be made with ignis crystal plates
    (from Thaumcraft's fire shards).
    Emeralds are easily obtainable from villagers.
    This allows us to craft cyan, red, and green lenses
    (yes, the green sapphire lens is technically cyan).
    The first two gives access to HV circuits and the latter to MV energy hatches.
    - The lack of access to Kanthal coils
        means you'll have to make SMD transistors.
        Annealed copper can be made in an EBF if you don't have an arc furnace.

- Craft an implosion compressor and compress garnets to gems.
    Powderbarrels can be used,
    or TNT can be crafted using toluene from wood tar.
    Craft blocks of red and yellow garnet,
    and use those to crossbreed a field of garnydinias.

- Processing garnets with nitric acid gives us access to many useful resources.
    Centrifuging red garnet gives pyrope, almandine, and spessartine;
    centrifuging yellow garnet gives andradite, grossular, and uvarovite.
    Now centrifuging those six dusts with nitric acid
    produces sluice juice,
    plus small quantities of rutile, vanadium, chrome, manganese, and tantalum.
    Centrifuging sluice juice itself gives antimony,
    and distilling it to sluice sand and running it through and electromagnetic separator
    gives neodymium.
    - Manganese can also be sourced by centrifuging lava,
        but lava production is harder to automate.

- This gives access to stainless steel and all HV machine components,
    thus unlocking pretty much all single-block HV machines.
    The most notable exception is HV energy hatch,
    which requires energetic alloy,
    which needs Kanthal coil blocks to smelt.

- Fluorine will have to be sourced from stone dust.
    Centrifuging stone dust gives biotite,
    which electrolyzes to fluorine.
    This gives access to polytetrafluoroethylene and Large Chemical Reactors.

- The cleanroom can be crafted and run,
    still using zinc from cobalt brass.
    Capacitors and small coils can be crafted with polyethylene,
    blue alloy is an alloy smelter recipe,
    and plastic circuit boards need just polyethylene, copper, H2SO4 and salt/chlorine.
    Thus you can craft both EV and IV circuits.

- Craft a vacuum freezer.
    The entire production chain of unformed fluorophlogopite
    can be made using only MV technology,
    magnesium from obsidian,
    potassium and rock salt from salty roots,
    silicon from SiO2 from flint dust,
    and fluorine from stone dust processing.
    The vacuum freezer gives the second-to-last step,
    which is producing fluorophlogopite plates.

- The next step is tierskipping with an MBF.
    Craft a Mega Blast Furnace;
    this can be done in an HV assembler.
    MBFs can be constructed with reinforced glass from IC2
    (wich has a steam-age alloy smelter recipe).
    Adding 8 MV energy hatches overclock the MBF to EV.
    Each tier beyond MV adds 100K to the baseline coil heat,
    thus reaching 2001K with cupronickel coils.
    This makes it possible to smelt titanium dust.
    - Before this step,
        the only source of titanium dust is scrapboxes.
        With 33 MV energy hatches would overclock the MBF to LuV,
        reaching 2201K with cupronickel coils,
        allowing us to use the rutile from garnet processing instead.

- Cool titanium down with your vacuum freezer.
    Magnetize the neodymium obtained from sluice sand,
    and we unlocked most EV machine components
    (except emitters and sensors).
    Most single-block EV machines are also accessible.

- Craft an EV bending machine,
    which can finally bend fluorophlogopite plates into mica insulator foils.
    This gives access to Kanthal coil blocks,
    and immediately afterwards nichrome coil blocks.

Additional and Alternative Strategies
-------------------------------------

- With questbook access,
    it is possible to purchase granitic mineral sand to get black granite.
    On average,
    9 granitic mineral sand ore gives enough black granite to make a black granite block,
    which allows black stonelillies to generate black granite.
    Finally,
    black granite can then be used as a source of fluorine.

- Once energetic alloy is accessible,
    the nano armor is craftable.
