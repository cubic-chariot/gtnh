GTNH: Garden of Grind
=====================

This document outlines a theoretical playthrough of the modpack
[GregTech: New Horizons](https://github.com/GTNewHorizons/GT-New-Horizons-Modpack),
in a skyblock-like setting.
We start from absolutely nothing,
and try to reconstruct as much as possible from GTNH.

I don't know much about GTNH itself,
so this document will evolve as I learn more about the modpack.


Rules
-----

Remove the mod Default World Generator
and create a superflat world with the preset `2;0;1;`.
This preset has Plains as the biome,
and no blocks at all.
You may not use the questbook rewards or travel to other dimensions.

Some structures may still generate, like Wichery circles;
you're not allowed to use them.
In the future,
this paragraph will be updated with instructions on how to disable them.

    an earlier GTNH skyblock concept.
    The main differences is that we don't change game rules
    (most notably, we keep `gamerule doMobSpawning true`)
    and we start with no items.

- [Stone Age Thaum by Aura#0696](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VF9HJPsaJasY_V_3OeJOX5RIRzGx5Xjfr-iBzzjfZGU);
    this documents outlines how to get started with Thaumcraft in Stone Age.
