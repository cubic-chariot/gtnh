GTNH: Garden of Grind
=====================

This document outlines a theoretical playthrough of the modpack
[GregTech: New Horizons](https://github.com/GTNewHorizons/GT-New-Horizons-Modpack),
in a skyblock-like setting.
We start from absolutely nothing,
and try to reconstruct as much as possible from GTNH.

I don't know much about GTNH itself,
so this document will evolve as I learn more about the modpack.


Rules
-----

Remove the mod Default World Generator
and create a superflat world with the preset `2;0;1;`.
This preset has Plains as the biome,
and no blocks at all.
You may not use the questbook rewards or travel to other dimensions.

Some structures may still generate, like Wichery circles;
you're not allowed to use them.
In the future,
this paragraph will be updated with instructions on how to disable them.

- [Skyblock Ruleset by Order#0001](<https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ajmpajbpw8H9rOpiPgX6AcUOcpdIfArwb-aoVrKly4I>);
    an earlier GTNH skyblock concept.
    The main differences is that we don't change game rules
    (most notably, we keep `gamerule doMobSpawning true`)
    and we start with no items.

- [Stone Age Thaum by Aura#0696](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VF9HJPsaJasY_V_3OeJOX5RIRzGx5Xjfr-iBzzjfZGU);
    this documents outlines how to get started with Thaumcraft in Stone Age.


Getting Started
===============

The first thing that happens when you join the world described above is:
you fall in the void and die.
This creates a grave from OpenBlocks with a block of dirt underneath.
When you respawn,
you will be on top of that block of dirt.
Throw yourself on the void again,
but a bit to the left.
This creates yet another block of dirt.
Repeat a few hundred times to gather building blocks.
Then we progress as follows:

- Build a rudimentary mobfarm. Kill enough infernal mobs until one of them drops a golden apple.
- Get a witch and a zombie villager to spawn side-by-side,
    anger the witch so that she throws a weakness potion on you,
    be close enough to the zombie so that it gets hit too,
    and feed it the golden apple;
    a few minutes later, you have a villager!
- Convert a few more villagers.
    Botania makes them shed emeralds,
    so you can purchase a Pam's sapling from a farmer.
    This gives access to wood.
- The crafting table recipe was unfortunately Gregified.
    Go back to your mob farm and wait till a Gravel Creeper spawns;
    it explodes in a bunch of gravel,
    which can be crafted into flint,
    which gives us crafting tables.
    (You can also make chests now,
    but if flint is too precious to you,
    use the droppers/dispensers dropped by infernal mobs as makeshift storage.)
- Zombies drop iron ingots, which can be used to make a full set of Gregtech tools.
    They also drop potatoes and carrots,
    which allows us to get started with crops!
    Infernal mobs also rarely drop diamonds,
    so you can make a plant lens (buy the glass from a librarian villager).
- Librarian villagers sell bookshelves,
    Heretic villagers sell profane wands,
    and a Thaumcraft table can be made using only iron and wood.
    This allows us to get started with Thaumcraft.
